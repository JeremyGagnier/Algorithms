# Algorithms

The goal of this project is to store algorithms like collision detection for various types of geometry, floating integer calculations, octree collision detection, polygon calculations, etc.

Currently there are only collision detection algorithms in C++. They are optimized and performance/unit tested, however some of them are incorrect.
